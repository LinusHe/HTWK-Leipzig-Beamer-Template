Standard density functional theory is insufficient to mimic the electronic gap energies at different symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional with screened exchange accurately reproduces the experimental band gaps and, more importantly, the alloy concentration of the direct-indirect gap crossovers for the III-V alloys studied here: AlGaAs, InAlAs, AlInP, InGaP, and GaAsP. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Vurgaftman2001,
abstract = {We present a comprehensive, up-to-date compilation of band parameters for the technologically important III-V zinc blende and wurtzite compound semiconductors: GaAs, GaSb, GaP, GaN, AlAs, AlSb, AlP, AlN, InAs, InSb, InP, and InN, along with their ternary and quaternary alloys. Based on a review of the existing literature, complete and consistent parameter sets are given for all materials. Emphasizing the quantities required for band structure calculations, we tabulate the direct and indirect energy gaps, spin-orbit, and crystal-field splittings, alloy bowing parameters, effective masses for electrons, heavy, light, and split-off holes, Luttinger parameters, interband momentum matrix elements, and deformation potentials, including temperature and alloy-composition dependences where available. Heterostructure band offsets are also given, on an absolute scale that allows any material to be aligned relative to any other. {\textcopyright} 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{VandeWalle2002,
abstract = {Although the formalism that allows the calculation of alloy thermodynamic properties from first-principles has been known for decades, its practical implementation has so far remained a tedious process. The Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) drastically simplifies this procedure by implementing decision rules based on formal statistical analysis that frees the researchers from a constant monitoring during the calculation process and automatically "glues" together the input and the output of various codes, in order to provide a high-level interface to the calculation of alloy thermodynamic properties from first-principles. ATAT implements the Structure Inversion Method (SIM), also known as the Connolly-Williams method, in combination with semi-grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations. In order to make this powerful toolkit available to the wide community of researchers who could benefit from it. this article present a concise user guide outlining the steps required to obtain thermodynamic information from ab initio calculations. {\textcopyright} 2003 Eisevier Science Ltd.

@article{Rosenow2018,
abstract = {While being of persistent interest for the integration of lattice-matched laser devices with silicon circuits, the electronic structure of dilute nitride III/V-semiconductors has presented a challenge to ab initio computational approaches. The origin of the computational problems is the strong distortion exerted by the N atoms on most host materials. Here, these issues are resolved by combining density functional theory calculations based on the meta-GGA functional presented by Tran and Blaha (TB09) with a supercell approach for the dilute nitride Ga(NAs). Exploring the requirements posed to supercells, it is shown that the distortion field of a single N atom must be allowed to decrease so far that it does not overlap with its periodic images. This also prevents spurious electronic interactions between translational symmetric atoms, allowing us to compute band gaps in very good agreement with experimentally derived reference values. In addition to existing approaches, these results offer a promising ab initio avenue to the electronic structure of dilute nitride semiconductor compounds.},

@article{Rubel2014,
abstract = {Supercells are often used in ab initio calculations to model compound alloys, surfaces, and defects. One of the main challenges of supercell electronic structure calculations is to recover the Bloch character of electronic eigenstates perturbed by disorder. Here we apply the spectral weight approach to unfolding the electronic structure of group III-V and II-VI semiconductor solid solutions. The illustrative examples include formation of donorlike states in dilute Ga(PN) and associated enhancement of its optical activity, direct observation of the valence band anticrossing in dilute GaAs:Bi, and a topological band crossover in ternary (HgCd)Te alloy accompanied by emergence of high-mobility Kane fermions. The analysis facilitates interpretation of optical and transport characteristics of alloys that are otherwise ambiguous in traditional first-principles supercell calculations.},
